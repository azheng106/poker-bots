this file should be used as a checklist for what to do

TODO
    - If everyone folds and one player remains, the game currently will keep looping until all community cards are
      passed out, and then move to the showdown. There, it will find the best hand and display unnecessary info.
      Instead, just make the player win the pot, and then set currentState to GameState::SETUP_HAND for the next hand.
